# Modified /clans

⚠️ The clans endpoint now requires pagination ⚠️

All parameters are now required: `page`, `pageSize`, `sort`, and `sortOrder`.

`pageSize` must be an integer less than 1,000.

This was necessary due to the growing size of total clans. Thank you.

# Added /clansTotal

Returns the integer amount of total clans

# Added /clansList

Returns a complete list of clan names
