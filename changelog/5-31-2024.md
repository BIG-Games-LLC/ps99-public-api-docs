# NOTE

I ended up rolling this update back due back until I have more time to fix some bugs.

# Updates to Collection Items

## New Fields Added

Added 3 new fields to every item's collection: `dateModified`, `dateCreated`, and `hash`.

## New Fields Details

1. **`dateModified`**:
   - **Description**: This field records the date and time when the item was last modified.
   - **Behavior**: 
     - When a new item is created, `dateModified` is set to the current date and time.
     - When an existing item is updated, `dateModified` is updated to the current date and time only if the `hash` value has changed.
     - If the `hash` value remains the same, `dateModified` will not change.

2. **`dateCreated`**:
   - **Description**: This field records the date and time when the item was first created.
   - **Behavior**:
     - When a new item is created, `dateCreated` is set to the current date and time.
     - For existing items before this update, `dateCreated` will be set to `null`. The goal is to eventually update these to accurate dates.

3. **`hash`**:
   - **Description**: This field stores a hash value based on the `configData` of the item.
   - **Behavior**:
     - The `hash` value is generated based on the `configData` content.
     - When `configData` changes, the `hash` value is recalculated and updated.
     - If `configData` remains the same, the `hash` value will not change.

## Impact on Existing Items

- **Existing Items**:
  - `dateCreated` is initially set to `null` for all items that existed before this update. The goal is to eventually update these to accurate dates.
  - `dateModified` is initially set to `null`. It will be set to the current date and time the first time it is updated after this release.
  - `hash` is calculated based on the current `configData` of each item.

## Goal of Change

With the introduction of these fields, you can now offer several new capabilities:

- **Changelogs**: By tracking `dateModified`, you can provide detailed changelogs that highlight when each item was last updated.
- **Historical Data Listings**: The `dateCreated` field allows you to list items based on their creation date, enabling the construction of historical data listings.
- **Data Integrity**: The `hash` field ensures data integrity by verifying the consistency of `configData`. Any change in `configData` is reflected in the `hash`, allowing us to detect modifications accurately.
